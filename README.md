# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
A Jupyter Notebook that classifies handwritten digits.

In this Jupyter Notebook I implemented a system which classifies handwritten digits. The data comes from the US Postal Service (handwritten on postal envelopes and scanned) and contains the digits 0 to 9 and is separated into train and test split. The data of each file represents the contents of an array (the values of the array elements are space-separated). Each line is for one digit (sample). The columns correspond to the features that describe the digits. For example, the value of the (i,j) element refers to the j-th attribute of the i-th digit. Each digit is described by 257 values, of which the first corresponds to the digit itself (if it is 0, 1, etc.) (class) and the remaining 256 are the features that describe it (grayscale values). The goal is the creation and evaluation of classifiers that will classify each of the digits included in the test data into one of the ten categories (from 0 to 9).
